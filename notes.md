# Notes

## Possible Funding

- [Syllabus 2.0 doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cc4sUSILFdjNC6AJvQai2XlA6c3UG0ccDfWcFPME7hc/edit)
- [USV Thesis 3.0](http://www.usv.com/blog/usv-thesis-30) - USV backs trusted brands that broaden access to knowledge, capital, and well-being by leveraging networks, platforms, and protocols. [Dani Grant](https://twitter.com/thedanigrant) is contact.

## Growing community

- Swag on merging PRs / Patreon perks. Swag like stickers/shirts/hoodies.
- Local learning meetups (like Freecodecamp does)
- Be active socially. Discord (real time chat), Twitter (announcements/polls/engagement), GitHub (code/issues/features/bugs), Reddit, YouTube (recording of meetings, launch videos, dev streams)
- Improve awareness of project. Great docs, everything should be documented ([Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) is great example). Easy flow to change any doc, remove all friction.
- Super clear guidelines on how to join the community, start contributing (whether its docs/code/ideas/anything). Have code of conduct in place so no one feels bad & everyone feels empowered.
- Best way to grow is have great product. Users will share & talk about it naturally. Encourage doing live streams of development, it's all open source code.

## Active Collaborations

- [Learn Awesome](https://learnawesome.org/)
- [Solvio](https://solvio.org)

## Possible Collaborations

- [ArtificialChat](https://artificial.chat) - Had a call with them (Paul Levy and main dev). Their stack is AWS heavy. LA can use its conversational bot

## Other

- Can use [Stripe connect](https://stripe.com/gb/connect) to create a marketplace for LA.
- Can use [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) to host Postgres db.
- Can give in multiple subjects & LA crafts a guide for you taking into account subjects you already know (& skipping them?)
- Can use [LRMI specification](http://lrmi.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/lrmi_1/). It's collection of properties to describe educational resources.

## Points to consider

- How to do secret management. Share passwords with trusted members.
- Need bank account & be incorporated. Potentially [b-corp](https://bcorporation.net)
