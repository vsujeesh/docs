# Ideas

Some things to consider based on [Discord discussions](https://discord.gg/KKYdWjt).

## Automation

Crawler:

- Find new topics
- Find new resources
- Study plans for jobs

Ranking:

- Filter spam
- Rank resources by difficulty
- Estimate how long it will take to "consume" a resource

## Possible places where we could get resources

- Goodreads
- Google knowledge graph
- Google custom engine
- YouTube
- Arxiv

## User actions

- Explore
- Learn
- Add resources (edit/delete) --> only within a certain time-frame and within permission access
- Add topics (edit/delete) --> only within a certain time-frame and within permission access
- Bookmark resources
- Follow topics
- Add dependencies to topics
- Create study plan

## To consider

- GDPR (abide by the European GDPR digital privacy law)
- Developer key for API
- Resources feed
- Reports
- Mod area
- Broadcast messages
- User feedback
- Multiple languages
- Next resource recommendation
- Topic recommendation

## Data needed to develop all the things above

- Visited resources/topics: Used for ranking resources or for generating
  suggestions.
- Saved resources: Save resources for later.
- Upvoted resources: You upvote to say "I went through this resource and
  I learned something from it". Maybe we can call it something else?
- Followed topics: Used to get new resources for that topic on your feed.
- Reports: Not sure how we'll manage them yet, but ideally there will be a
  list and mods can go through the reports and check if resources/topics
  are spam or not.
- Added resources/topics/plans/dependencies
- Nick (registration): We could show the author of resources/study plans,
  add the possibility to follow a user (get the resources they added on your
  feed), have leaderboards. All to debate and all in a very distant future.
